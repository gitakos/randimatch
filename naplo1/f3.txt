Today was... well, it was a lot. One of those days that hits you in waves, like youre standing at the edge of the ocean and youre not sure if the next one is going to pull you under or just soak your shoes.

It started with the sound of Mom yelling up the stairs. "Noah, youre going to miss the bus!" Typical. I barely had time to grab my hoodie before running out the door with a granola bar in my mouth. I know I shouldnt skip breakfast, but mornings are chaos, and honestly, Im just trying to survive until homeroom.

On the bus, my earbuds decided to stop working-again. So, instead of drowning out the noise, I got to listen to Tommy arguing with Jenna about some dumb TikTok trend. I swear, they could argue about the color of the sky if given the chance. I tuned them out as best I could, staring out the window at the frost-covered lawns. Winters definitely here, but it hasnt snowed yet. Theres something kind of sad about that, like the worlds holding its breath.

School wasnt any better. First period was biology, and were in the middle of this lab about ecosystems. I was supposed to work with Kai, but he barely showed up. When he finally dragged himself in 15 minutes late, he looked like he hadnt slept in a week. "Rough night?" I asked, trying to keep it light.

He just nodded and mumbled something about his dad being on his case. I didnt push. Kais been weird lately, quieter than usual. I guess we all have stuff going on, but its hard to know how to help when someone doesnt want to talk.

By lunch, I was starving. I found a spot at the usual table with Jonah and Lucas, but things felt... off. Jonah was scrolling through his phone, barely saying two words, and Lucas was ranting about some game update that "ruined everything." I tried to chime in, but they werent really listening. Its funny how you can feel alone even when youre surrounded by people.

The afternoon was a little better. In art class, Ms. Rivera asked us to paint something that represented how we were feeling. At first, I just stared at the blank canvas, thinking about how much I didnt want to be there. But then I started mixing colors-blues and grays mostly-and ended up painting this abstract swirl that kind of looked like a storm. Ms. Rivera walked by and said, "Thats powerful, Noah. Keep going."

I dont know why, but that stuck with me. Maybe its because she actually noticed, or maybe its because I realized how much I needed to let some of that storm out.

After school, I had my shift at the library. Its a quiet job, shelving books and helping people find stuff, but I like it. Theres this calmness to the place that makes the rest of the world feel less loud. Mrs. Chen, the librarian, always lets me work in the back when things are slow, and I spent an hour reorganizing the graphic novels.

At one point, this little kid came up to me with a book in his hands. "Do you have more like this?" he asked, holding up Percy Jackson and the Olympians.

"Yeah," I said, smiling. "Youre gonna love the rest of the series."

I showed him where they were, and his face lit up like Christmas morning. It was a small moment, but it felt good-like maybe I made his day a little better.

When my shift ended, it was already dark outside. The air was freezing, and I could see my breath in front of me as I walked home. I thought about texting Dad to pick me up, but I didnt feel like dealing with his questions about school or what colleges Im applying to.

Dinner was quiet, as usual. Mom asked if I had any homework, and I told her Id get to it after I ate. My little sister, Grace, was babbling about some drama with her friends, and Dad was buried in his laptop. I picked at my food, not really hungry, and snuck back to my room as soon as I could.

Now Im here, staring at the mess on my desk. Books, papers, a half-finished sketch from last week. I should clean it, but instead, I opened this notebook to write.

I keep thinking about what Ms. Rivera said. "Thats powerful." I dont feel powerful. Most days, I feel like Im just floating through, trying not to screw up. But maybe theres something to the idea of letting the storm out. Ive been holding so much in lately-pressure from school, my friends drifting, Kai shutting me out. Maybe its time to do something about it.

Heres what Im going to try:

Check on Kai tomorrow. Even if he doesnt want to talk, at least hell know someones there.
Finish that sketch. Its been sitting there for too long, and I think I know what it needs.
Start writing more. Not just about my day, but about the stuff I cant say out loud.
The heater just kicked on, and the house is quiet except for the hum of it. Grace is probably asleep, and Dads probably still at his laptop. I should get to bed, but I think Ill sit here a little longer, letting the storm settle.

Goodnight, Diary. Tomorrows another chance to figure it all out.
