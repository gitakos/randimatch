The weird thing about today is how normal it started. I rolled out of bed with my alarm blaring in my ear-something Ive been meaning to change for weeks now. That default ringtone is like nails on a chalkboard. Anyway, it was one of those mornings where everything felt slightly off, like I was walking around in someone elses house. My toothbrush felt rougher, the cereal tasted stale, and my hair wouldnt sit right no matter how much water I slapped on it.

Dad was already gone when I came downstairs. He had a flight to catch for some conference or other-hes always flying somewhere. Mom was sipping her tea at the kitchen table, scrolling on her phone. She asked if Id remembered to pack my science project, and I told her I had, even though I hadnt. I grabbed it on my way out, the model volcano barely fitting into my bag.

The bus ride to school was boring, as usual. I sat near the window, trying to lose myself in the music on my headphones. Some old album I found last week. Its kind of cool, the way old songs feel fresh when youre hearing them for the first time.

At school, the day started dragging immediately. First-period math was unbearable, and Mr. Greene kept talking about proofs like they were the key to happiness. I was doodling in the margins of my notebook when I heard my name.

"Liam, would you care to share your thoughts on the problem?"

I stared at the board like it was written in an alien language. "Uh... could you repeat the question?"

A few kids laughed, but Mr. Greene just sighed and moved on. I think hes given up on me at this point.

Things got a little better in history class. Were doing this group project on famous explorers, and my group chose Sir Ernest Shackleton. I ended up researching him for hours last night-not because I had to, but because his story is incredible. He led this expedition to Antarctica, and when everything went wrong, he somehow kept his crew alive against all odds. I told my group about it, and even Sara-who usually spends the whole class texting-seemed interested.

Lunch was a mixed bag. I sat with the usual crew-Ethan, Josh, and Miles-but something felt off. Josh kept making jokes that were a little too mean, especially towards Ethan, who just laughed it off like he always does. I wanted to say something, but I didnt. I dont know why. Maybe I didnt want to ruin the vibe, or maybe I just chickened out.

The afternoon flew by after that. We had an assembly about some new school policy-no phones in the hallways or something. The principals speech was so boring that half the auditorium was either asleep or whispering to each other. I spent the whole time thinking about Shackleton and wondering what it wouldve been like to be on his ship, stuck in the middle of an icy wasteland. Would I have been brave enough to follow him? Or would I have just given up?

After school, I had soccer practice. Its been cold lately, so we practiced indoors, which is always weird. The ball moves differently on the gym floor, faster and less predictable. Coach kept yelling at us to communicate better, but honestly, were not bad. I scored a goal during our scrimmage, which felt awesome. Miles was goalie, and I could tell he wasnt happy about it.

When practice ended, I walked home instead of taking the bus. I needed the air, I guess. The sky was this perfect mix of orange and purple, like the sunset was trying to paint something but couldnt decide on the colors. I stopped at the park and sat on one of the swings, letting my legs dangle.

Thats when I saw her. Mia. She was sitting on a bench with her sketchbook, headphones on, completely lost in whatever she was drawing. Ive liked her since sixth grade, but Ive never worked up the courage to talk to her. I thought about saying hi, but what would I even say? "Hey, cool sketchbook"? Lame. So, I just watched her for a minute before heading home.

Dinner was fine. Mom made spaghetti, and Emma spent the whole meal talking about her class hamster, Mr. Nibbles. Apparently, he escaped his cage today, and it was a big deal. I think shes more invested in his life than her own sometimes.

After dinner, I locked myself in my room and tried to focus on homework, but my brain kept drifting. I thought about Shackleton, and Joshs jokes, and Mia sitting on that bench. Its like all these little moments from the day were bouncing around in my head, refusing to settle.

I ended up writing a list. I do that sometimes when my thoughts get too loud. I just write everything down, no matter how random it seems. Heres what I came up with:

Talk to Mia. Seriously, just say something. Anything.
Ask Josh to go easy on Ethan.
Look up more about Shackleton.
Figure out how to fix the stupid volcano before tomorrow.
Change my alarm tone.
Its a weird list, but it helps. Seeing it written down makes it all feel a little more manageable.

Now its late, and I can hear Emma laughing at some cartoon downstairs. Moms probably asleep on the couch, and the house is quiet except for the faint hum of the heater. I like this time of night, when everything feels still and safe.

Tomorrows another day, and maybe Ill cross a few things off my list. Or maybe I wont. But for now, Im okay with just writing it all down and letting it be.

Goodnight, Diary.
