Ive been thinking a lot about how people remember things. Like, what makes one day stick in your mind while others fade into the background? Some days just feel more... vivid. Today wasnt one of those days, but I want to write it down anyway. Maybe in the future, Ill read this and feel something I missed in the moment.

The alarm went off at 6:30 as usual. I hit snooze twice, which I know is a bad habit, but its just so hard to get out of bed in the winter. The mornings are dark and cold, and my blankets feel like the coziest place in the world. But Mom knocked on my door at 6:50, reminding me Id be late for the bus if I didnt hurry.

Breakfast was toast and peanut butter-quick and easy. Mom was reading the news on her phone, and Dad was already out the door for work. I asked her if anything interesting was happening in the world, and she just sighed and said, "The same as always." Thats Moms way of saying the news is too depressing to talk about.

School was... well, school. First period was biology, and were dissecting frogs this week. Im not squeamish or anything, but I still felt kind of bad cutting into a frog. It wasnt even about the grossness; it just seemed unfair that this little creature had to die so I could learn about its organs. Mrs. Talbot said something about respecting the process, but I dont know. It felt weird.

Second period was Spanish, and we had a quiz. I think I did okay, but there was one question about irregular verbs that completely threw me. I guessed, so fingers crossed its right.

The highlight of the day was probably lunch, which is kind of sad if you think about it. I sat with Alex and Jordan, as usual. Alex was complaining about his geometry teacher, and Jordan kept making bad puns. At one point, Jordan said something so ridiculous I almost choked on my sandwich. It was nice, though-one of those moments where you forget about everything else for a little while.

After lunch, we had an assembly about college readiness. Im only a junior, but theyre already trying to stress us out about applications and career paths. The speaker was this guy who kept using buzzwords like "networking" and "growth mindset." I zoned out about halfway through and started doodling in the margins of my notebook.

When school finally ended, I walked home. Its not a long walk-maybe 20 minutes-but its enough time to clear my head. I like the quiet of it, especially after a noisy day. The sky was this pale gray that looked almost like snow, but it didnt smell like snow, if that makes sense. I know itll snow soon, though. You can feel it coming.

When I got home, Milo (our cat, not to be confused with the dog from next door) was curled up in my desk chair. He gave me this annoyed look when I tried to move him, like I was disturbing his very important nap. I ended up letting him stay and just sat on the floor while I did my homework.

Speaking of homework, I had way too much of it tonight. Math, English, and history all at once. Math wasnt too bad-it was just some problems about exponential functions. English, though... were supposed to write an essay about a book that changed our perspective, and I have no idea what to pick. Do comic books count? Probably not.

History was kind of interesting, though. Were studying the Civil Rights Movement, and the assignment was to analyze a speech. I chose Martin Luther King Jr.s "I Have a Dream." Its such a powerful speech, even though Ive heard it a million times before. Theres this one part where he talks about the "fierce urgency of now," and that phrase has been stuck in my head all evening.

After dinner (chicken stir-fry-one of Moms specialties), I went outside for a bit. I like to sit on the porch and just listen to the world. Tonight, it was especially quiet. No cars, no barking dogs, just the faint sound of the wind in the trees.

Thats when I started thinking about memory again. Like, in 10 years, will I remember this moment? Will I remember how the air smelled, or the way the porch creaked under my weight? Probably not. But maybe thats okay. Maybe not everything needs to be memorable to matter.

Anyway, its getting late, and I should probably go to bed. Tomorrows another day, and who knows? Maybe itll be one of those vivid ones that sticks with me. Or maybe itll be another ordinary day. Either way, Ill be here, writing it all down.

Goodnight, Diary.
