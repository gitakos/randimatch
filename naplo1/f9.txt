Today started like any other day. The alarm buzzed its annoying beep-beep-beep, and I groaned, slapping it off before pulling the blanket back over my head. Mom yelled from downstairs, reminding me that if I didnt get up soon, Id miss the bus. Shes been saying that every morning since I started middle school, but its not like Id actually miss it. The bus drivers always late anyway.

I stumbled out of bed and threw on the first clothes I found: a wrinkled t-shirt and a pair of jeans Im pretty sure I wore two days ago. Whatever. Nobody notices stuff like that unless youre one of the popular kids, and Im definitely not. Im just... me. Average. Nothing special.

Breakfast was rushed. Mom made pancakes, but they were the weird kind with oatmeal in them. She says its healthier, but Id rather have the ones from a box mix. I drowned them in syrup, though, so they were tolerable. Dad was already gone for work by the time I came downstairs. Hes been working long hours lately, something about a big project deadline. I barely see him except on weekends now.

The bus ride was the usual chaos. Danny and Chris were arguing about who could eat more hot wings without throwing up. Danny swears he can do 20, but Chris says hes lying. I dont get why theyre so obsessed with proving whos tougher. Its just hot wings. Across the aisle, Emily was showing off her new phone case to Lisa. Its glittery and has a little unicorn charm dangling from it. She was laughing that loud laugh she does, the one thats kind of annoying but also sort of... nice? Not that Id ever tell her that.

School itself was fine, I guess. First period was math, and Mr. Gonzalez gave us a surprise quiz. I think I did okay, but there was one question about fractions that Im pretty sure I bombed. I could feel my palms sweating as I handed it in, hoping Mr. Gonzalez wouldnt give me that disappointed look he always does when someone messes up. English was next, and were reading some old book called To Kill a Mockingbird. Its not as boring as I thought it would be. Actually, its kind of interesting, though Id never admit that to anyone in class. Marcus would probably make fun of me for a week if he found out.

Lunchtime was the usual awkward mix of trying to find a seat and avoiding the "cool table." Not that Id ever want to sit there anyway. Theyre always so loud, making fun of people or bragging about stuff. I ended up sitting with Ben and Alex. Theyre my best friends, though we dont really talk about deep stuff or anything. Mostly, we just argue about video games and complain about school. Today, Ben was going on about this new game he wants to get called Galactic Conquest. He says its got the best graphics ever, but Alex rolled his eyes and said graphics dont matter if the gameplays trash. Ive never been much of a gamer, so I just nodded along, pretending to care more than I actually did.

After lunch, we had gym, which is probably my least favorite class. Coach Parker had us running laps again. Hes obsessed with making us "build endurance," but all it does is make everyone complain about how sweaty they are. Im not terrible at running, but Im not great either. Middle of the pack, as usual. Danny and Chris turned it into a race, of course, and Chris ended up tripping over his own feet. He went sprawling onto the track, and everyone laughed, even Coach Parker. Chris just got up, grinning like hed done it on purpose, but his cheeks were bright red.

The rest of the school day was a blur. Science was boring-just more notes about ecosystems and food chains. History was a little better because we got to watch a documentary about ancient Egypt. I think ancient civilizations are cool, especially the pyramids. Its wild to think people built those without any machines.

When the final bell rang, I grabbed my stuff and headed for the bus. The ride home was quieter than the morning. Most people were staring at their phones or listening to music. I stared out the window, watching the trees blur past. Its finally starting to feel like spring, and the sun was shining for the first time in what feels like weeks. I saw a couple of birds chasing each other through the air and wondered if they were playing or fighting.

When I got home, Mom was on the phone, talking to Aunt Sarah about some family reunion shes planning. I dropped my bag by the door and headed to my room. Homework was waiting, but I wasnt ready to deal with it yet. Instead, I flopped onto my bed and stared at the ceiling.

Sometimes, I feel like my life is on repeat. Wake up, go to school, come home, do homework, sleep, and then do it all over again. Its not bad, exactly, just... boring. I keep thinking about what itll be like when Im older. Will I have some amazing job where every day is exciting? Will I travel the world or live in a big city? Or will I still be stuck in some routine, just with different problems to deal with?

After a while, I pulled out my sketchpad. Drawings one of the only things that makes me feel like time isnt just ticking by. Im not amazing or anything, but I like creating stuff. Today, I started sketching a dragon perched on a rocky cliff. Its wings were spread wide, and I tried to make it look like it was about to take off into the sky. I lost track of time while I worked on it, shading the scales and adding details to the background. By the time I looked up, it was almost dinnertime.

Dinner was spaghetti, which is one of my favorites. Mom asked about my day, and I gave her the usual "It was fine" answer. Shes always saying she wants to hear more about what Im up to, but I dont know how to explain that most of my day isnt worth talking about. Its just normal stuff.

After dinner, I finally tackled my homework. Math took forever because I couldnt figure out one of the problems. I ended up texting Ben to see if hed done it, and he sent me a picture of his worksheet. I copied his answer but still tried to work it out on my own to see if it made sense. It didnt. English was easier-just a couple of questions about the book were reading. I actually kind of like writing answers when its about something interesting.

Once my homework was done, I played around on my phone for a bit, scrolling through videos and memes. I saw one of a cat trying to fit into a tiny box, and it made me laugh so hard I almost fell off my chair. Its funny how something so small can totally change your mood.

Before bed, I read a little. Not the school book, but a fantasy novel Ive been working through. Its about a kid who finds out he has magical powers and has to save his kingdom from an evil sorcerer. I know it sounds cheesy, but its actually really good. I like imagining what it would be like to have powers, to do something important. Sometimes, I wish my life were more like the books I read. But then I think about how dangerous it would be, and Im not so sure.

Now Im lying here, writing this. I dont usually keep a diary, but something about today made me want to try it. Maybe its because Ive been feeling kind of restless lately, like theres something Im supposed to be doing but I dont know what it is. Or maybe I just needed to get all these thoughts out of my head.

Anyway, I guess thats it for today. Nothing special happened, but it wasnt a bad day either. Just another day in the life of me. Maybe tomorrow will be different. Who knows? For now, Im going to try to sleep and see what dreams come. Maybe Ill dream about that dragon I was drawing. That would be cool.

Goodnight, diary.
