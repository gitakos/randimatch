Im not even sure where to begin today. Its been one of those days when it feels like everything is out of my control-like Im just floating through life, and nothing I do really makes a difference. I woke up this morning feeling heavy, like there was a weight on my chest that wouldnt lift. The bed was too warm and cozy, and the thought of getting up and facing the world felt like a Herculean task. I lay there for a few minutes, staring at the ceiling, trying to gather the strength to move. The truth is, I just didnt want to deal with anything today-not school, not friends, not the future. I just wanted to pull the covers over my head and disappear for a while.

I finally dragged myself out of bed, my body feeling like it was moving through molasses. The shower was a blur, the water lukewarm against my skin. I couldnt muster the energy to care about whether it was hot or cold-it was just water. As I stood there, I found myself staring at the tiles, lost in thought. I keep wondering when things got so hard, when everything seemed to become a struggle. Its like one day, everything was fine, and the next, I was drowning in expectations and responsibilities that I wasnt ready for. I thought about skipping breakfast-my stomach was doing that knotting thing again-but my mom would worry, so I pushed through it, forcing down a piece of toast and a glass of juice.

School was... well, school. I managed to get there on time, which felt like a minor victory given how I usually scramble out of bed at the last minute. The day started off okay, or as okay as it can get when youre sleep-deprived and just not feeling it. First period was history, and I tried to focus on the lecture, but my mind kept wandering. I couldnt concentrate-I kept thinking about everything I had to do, all the assignments, tests, projects piling up. Its like I cant see the finish line anymore; I just see the blur of steps leading up to it. I keep asking myself why it feels so hard now, why everything feels like a struggle, but theres no answer. Its like Ive forgotten how to make it all work.

The math test this morning was a disaster. I felt confident going in-thought maybe Id miraculously remember everything-but as soon as I saw the questions, it all fell apart. I tried to take deep breaths, calm myself down, but nothing worked. My mind was racing, thoughts bouncing around, and before I knew it, the bell had rung and I was turning in a paper full of guesses. I know it wasnt my best effort, but there was nothing else I could do. I just wanted to run out of there and never come back. The look on my teachers face when she handed back the papers said it all-disappointment. I dont know why I expected anything different. I just feel like Im constantly letting everyone down, like Im never good enough.

Lunch was a brief escape-at least, thats what I kept telling myself as I sat alone in the corner of the cafeteria. My friends were chatting and laughing, and for a moment, I thought about joining them, pretending everything was fine. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. It was like I had lost my voice. I kept my eyes on my plate, pushing around the food, not really hungry but not really caring either. Its like Ive forgotten how to connect with people, how to have a normal conversation. Everyone else seems so put together, so sure of themselves, and here I am, just trying to keep my head above water. I felt invisible-like if I just stayed quiet, no one would notice I was there.

The rest of the day was a blur-more classes, more work, more feeling overwhelmed. I had a free period in the library, but I couldnt bring myself to read or study. I just sat there, staring at the wall, feeling like my brain was filled with static. I thought about what I wanted to do after school, where I wanted to go, but the answers felt out of reach. I know I should be planning for the future, setting goals, but everything felt too big today-too impossible to even think about. I just felt stuck, like I was spinning my wheels and going nowhere. Every time I tried to focus, my mind would drift back to that math test, back to the list of things I hadnt done, and I felt like a failure.

Soccer practice was supposed to be a relief, a chance to blow off steam and forget about everything, but it wasnt. It was the same-the pressure to perform, the fear of making mistakes, the feeling that I wasnt good enough. I used to love being on the field, feeling the rush of the game, the connection with the team. But today, it was like my body didnt want to cooperate. Every pass was off, every shot was weak, and I could feel my coachs frustration growing. I know he believes in me, but today, it felt like he was seeing someone else-someone who wasnt up to the task. I just wanted to quit, to stop pretending I could keep up, but I didnt. I kept going, kept making mistake after mistake, because theres a part of me that still wants to believe I can get through this.

When I got home, it was like a weight had lifted-finally, some space to breathe. But even that didnt help. I had so much homework waiting for me-essays to write, math problems to solve, projects to start-and I just couldnt face it. I sat in my room, staring at my desk, and the thoughts kept racing through my head. Im not good enough. I cant do this. Why does everything feel so hard? I thought about talking to my mom, telling her how I was feeling, but every time I tried, the words wouldnt come out. Its like theres this barrier between what I feel and what I can say, and its suffocating. I ended up doing nothing-just laying on my bed, listening to music, trying to escape from my own head.

Dinner was... uneventful. Mom made spaghetti, and I tried to eat, but my stomach was in knots. We made small talk-how was your day, whats going on at school-but I couldnt find the words to tell her how I was really feeling. I know shes worried about me, that she can see somethings wrong, but I just cant put it into words. I feel like Im disappointing everyone-my friends, my parents, myself. I thought about quitting soccer, stopping the things that feel like too much, but theres this fear of letting people down, of not being able to follow through on what I started. Its like Im trapped, stuck in this cycle of doing things that make me unhappy because I dont know how to change it.

After dinner, I went back to my room, hoping that maybe a good nights sleep would help clear my head. But when I closed my eyes, it was the same-the list of things I hadnt done, the things I should have done, the things Ill have to do tomorrow. Its like my brain is on a loop, and I cant turn it off. I keep thinking about the future, about where Im going and what I want to do, but it feels like theres no path forward, no way to break free from the uncertainty. I know I need to make changes, to do something different, but Im scared-scared of failing, scared of not being enough.

Tonight, I just felt really alone. I wanted to reach out to someone-my friends, my family, even a teacher-but the words just wouldnt come. Its like Im trapped in my own head, unable to escape the noise and the chaos. I know Im not the only one who feels this way, but it doesnt make it any easier. I keep thinking about what my life would be like if I could just push through this, if I could find a way to be happy again. But right now, it feels like theres no end in sight, no solution to the weight on my chest. I just want to stop feeling like Im drowning.

I ended up going to bed early tonight, hoping that maybe tomorrow will be better. But when I closed my eyes, all I could think about was how today was just another day of feeling stuck, feeling lost. I know Im capable of more-I just dont know how to get there. Its like theres this gap between where I am and where I want to be, and I dont know how to bridge it. I keep telling myself that it will get better, but its hard to believe it when everything feels so heavy.

Goodnight, Diary.
