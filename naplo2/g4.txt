I cant believe its already December. It feels like this year has just flown by, and yet here I am, feeling like Im stuck in the same place I was back in January. The days blend together, and its hard to remember when things started feeling so heavy. I woke up this morning feeling like a weight was pressing down on me-the alarm went off, and I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, not wanting to move. Its like Im trapped in a fog, every step forward feels like an uphill battle, and I dont know how to break free.

I finally forced myself out of bed and into the shower, hoping that the water would wash away the feeling of dread that had settled in my chest. But it didnt work. I stood there for what felt like an eternity, letting the hot water run over me, trying to shake the heaviness in my mind, but it stayed. I kept thinking about everything I had to do today-school, homework, soccer practice-feeling like I was barely going to be able to get through any of it. The future feels so uncertain, so far away, and its terrifying. I feel like Im standing at the edge of a cliff, looking down into this abyss, and I dont know how to take that first step.

Getting ready for school was a struggle. I went through the motions-brushed my teeth, threw on a sweater and jeans, grabbed a granola bar for breakfast-but nothing felt real. I felt like a ghost, just going through the day without actually living it. The bus ride was long and silent, everyone lost in their own thoughts, their own worlds. I felt so disconnected, like I didnt belong there anymore. When I got to school, it was the same-walking through the halls, seeing everyones faces, but feeling like I was on the outside looking in. Its like Ive lost my place, my footing, and I dont know how to find it again.

The first few classes were a blur. I couldnt focus, couldnt keep up with what the teachers were saying. My mind kept wandering-thinking about the past, about how things used to be so easy, so simple. Now its like everything is a struggle-every note I take, every problem I try to solve. I felt like I was on the edge of tears the whole time, just trying to keep it together. Its like theres this constant weight on my chest, this pressure that wont go away. I kept thinking about how I used to love school, how I used to be so excited to learn, and now it feels like a chore, like something I have to do to get by.

Lunch was just as hard. I ended up sitting alone, picking at my food, not really hungry. I kept thinking about how my friends used to be-how we used to laugh and joke, how we used to know everything about each other. Now it feels like theres this wall between us, like I cant get close to anyone anymore. I kept thinking about all the things Ive lost-my old confidence, my ability to just be myself-and it felt like I was grieving for something that was gone forever. I wanted to join in the conversation, to be a part of it, but it felt like there was this huge barrier between me and everyone else. Its like Ive forgotten how to connect, how to open up.

The afternoon was more of the same-struggling to keep my head above water, struggling to concentrate. I had a free period in the library, and I tried to read, to lose myself in a book, but it was pointless. My thoughts kept drifting, kept coming back to the same things-my future, my friends, my family. It felt like there were so many things I needed to say, so many things I needed to figure out, but I didnt know how to start. Its like theres this fog in my mind, this cloud that makes it impossible to see anything clearly. I felt like I was stuck in a loop-going through the motions, feeling like none of it mattered.

Soccer practice was supposed to be my escape, but today it was just another reminder of how lost I feel. I couldnt get anything right-every pass was off target, every shot went wide. I felt so clumsy, so out of place on the field. My coach kept giving me tips, trying to help, but it felt like he was speaking a different language. I felt like I was letting the team down, letting myself down. Every mistake felt amplified, like I was doing everything wrong. I wanted to leave, to walk away from it all, but I stayed because its the one thing I used to be good at, the one place where I used to feel at home.

When I got home, it was like the exhaustion hit me all at once. I just wanted to lie down and not move, but there was still so much to do-homework, chores, studying for exams. I tried to sit down and work, but my mind was all over the place-thoughts racing in every direction. I felt like I was drowning in my own head-too many worries, too many doubts. I kept thinking about how I used to be able to handle all of this, how I used to be able to keep everything in check, and now it feels like Im just treading water. I felt like I was spinning my wheels-never getting anywhere, never getting any closer to figuring things out.

Dinner was quiet. My parents tried to talk to me, to ask how my day was, but I couldnt find the words to tell them. Its like Ive forgotten how to ask for help, how to be honest about what Im feeling. I didnt want to worry them, didnt want to add to their stress, but it was hard to keep pretending that everything was okay when it clearly wasnt. I kept thinking about how it used to be-how we used to talk about everything, how they used to understand me without me having to explain. Now it feels like theres this huge gap between us, and I dont know how to bridge it.

After dinner, I went to my room, hoping that maybe writing in my diary would help, but even that felt hard. The words wouldnt come-the thoughts were jumbled, like I was trying to untangle a ball of string that kept knotting back up. I kept thinking about the day-about how nothing seemed to go right, how everything felt like a struggle. Its like theres this darkness in my head-this cloud that makes it impossible to see anything clearly. I felt like I was stuck in a cycle of self-doubt, of never being enough. I kept thinking about the future-about what I want to do with my life, where I want to be-but every time I tried to picture it, the image was hazy, uncertain. Its like Im standing at a crossroads, and I dont know which path to take.

Tonight, I just felt really alone. I wanted to talk to someone-my friends, my parents, anyone- but the words got stuck in my throat. Its like Ive forgotten how to ask for help, how to be honest about what Im feeling. I kept thinking about all the times I used to be able to talk about everything-how it used to feel so easy to share, to be open. Now its like Im afraid of being a burden, afraid of letting anyone see how much Im struggling. I miss the old me-the one who wasnt afraid to be herself, who wasnt afraid to ask for help when she needed it. Now it feels like every day is a battle, and I dont know how to fight it anymore.

I ended up going to bed early tonight, hoping that maybe tomorrow will be better. But when I closed my eyes, it was the same-the thoughts racing through my head, the weight on my chest. I keep thinking about the future-about what I want to do, where I want to be-and it feels like theres this massive gap between now and then. I dont know how to get there, how to bridge that gap. Its like Im standing at the edge of a cliff, looking down, and I dont know how to take that first step. I feel lost, and its hard not to feel like Im the only one who doesnt have it all figured out.
